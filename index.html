                <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
                <p>The internet has the potential to uplift society — it can promote democracy, open markets, and free expression. But it can also promote polarization, mass surveillance, and misinformation.</p>
                <p>More than ever, we need a movement to ensure the internet remains a force for good. That’s where you come in. The MIECO Program fuels this movement by supporting people like you who are looking to advance a more human-centered internet. We take care of the hard stuff – providing funding, mentorship, and amplification – so you can focus all-in on building the future we all envision.</p>
                <h2>What does the program entail?</h2>
                <p>The MIECO program is a 12-month experience where you will propose, design, and drive a new product or domain in a small cohort of like-minded builders.</p>
                <p>Preference will be given to projects that address underserved communities on the internet, provide or support fairer value exchange, and are built in an open manner – aka projects that can be built upon by others (e.g., coding done with open source, providing open access to use part or all of the solution etc as compared to projects done in a solely proprietary manner).</p>
                <small>*Timeline can be adjusted once accepted into the program.</small>
                <h2>Who should apply?</h2>
                <p>If you have a passion to create a healthier and more accessible internet, then you! You will need to identify a specific challenge that you want to explore and show a body of work or consistent activity over 12-24 months to demonstrate a passion for the topic. It’s alright if your project already exists.</p>
                <h2>How do I apply?</h2>
                <p>We will be opening up the application window for our 2nd cohort in 2023. Please fill out the form below to be informed when this is live!</p>

            <h2><span class="dark-highlight">Frequently Asked <br> Questions</span></h2>
            <h3>Is the Mozilla Internet Ecosystem (MIECO) Program a full-time program?</h3>
            <p>No. This is meant to supplement or extend existing work or can be used to enable someone to test a new concept that they haven’t yet been able to invest time in.</p>
            <h3>Will Mozilla own or be able to control any part of my intellectual property in exchange for the grant funding?</h3>
            <p>This funding is going directly to the individuals and is not an exchange of equity for funding. Mozilla will not take ownership of anything that the participants build during the program. However, we do have a preference for working in an open manner, and would appreciate any assets developed that can be donated to the open source community.</p>
            <h3>What is the duration of the MIECO Program?</h3>
            <p>Most projects will run for 12 months, though some projects may be better executed on a shorter or longer time line which can be agreed upon once the Builder is offered a spot in the program.</p>
